# Carbon Black Response: Intel Tester

This can be used to test out new IOC's, baseline user/process behaviors and much more. The script works by taking a list of queries defined in your `config.json` file and using your defined start date to run a day by day check on each query. The results are saved to a csv file for you to review.
